    """Normalize data to mean 0 and std 1 with high numerical stability.

    This function is designed to be robust against several edge cases:
    1.  **Constant Features**: If a feature is constant, its standard deviation (`std`)
        will be 0. This is handled by replacing `std=0` with `1` to prevent `0/0`
        division, effectively mapping constant features to a normalized value of 0.
    2.  **Single-Sample Normalization**: If the normalization is based on a single
        data point, `std` is explicitly set to `1` to prevent undefined behavior.
    3.  **Low-Precision Dtypes**: During the final division, a small epsilon (`1e-16`)
        is added to the denominator. This prevents division by a near-zero `std`,
        which could cause the value to overflow to infinity (`inf`), especially when
        using low-precision dtypes like `torch.float16`.
    4.  **Autograd Compatibility**: All inplace operations (`x[:] = ...`) have been
        replaced with their functional equivalents (`torch.where`, `torch.ones_like`)
        to ensure the computation graph is not corrupted, allowing gradients to be
        computed correctly.

    Args:
        data: The data to normalize. (T, B, H)
        normalize_positions: If > 0, only use the first `normalize_positions`
            positions for normalization.
        return_scaling: If True, return the scaling parameters as well (mean, std).
        std_only: If True, only divide by std.
        clip: If True, clip the data to [-100, 100].
        mean: If given, use this value instead of computing it.
        std: If given, use this value instead of computing it.
