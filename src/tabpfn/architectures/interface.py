                below.

            categorical_inds: The indices of categorical features.

            force_recompute_layer: If True, enable activation checkpointing for this
                forward pass. If False, the model may use activation checkpointing as
                determined by its config. This is useful, during training, to only
                enable checkpointing for particularly large datasets, while usually
                keeping it disabled.

            save_peak_memory_factor:
                If not None, enable batching internally in the model. This reduces the
                peak memory usage by chunking the inputs to various layers (e.g.
                attention, MLP, and layer norm) along the batch dimension, and
                processing each chunk sequentially rather than as one larger tensor. The
                value of this option determines how many chunks the input is divided
                into; a higher value results in lower peak memory consumption.

                This can only be used during inference. Some architectures do not
                support it and will ignore this option.

                If None, this feature is disabled.

        Returns:
            If `only_return_standard_out`, then a Tensor of shape
            `(test rows, batch size, num classes)`, which is the output of the
            standard decoder.
            Otherwise, a dictionary containing the output of each decoder, and also:
                - "train_embeddings": The output of the encoder on the training data.
                - "test_embeddings": The output of the encoder on the test data.
            Particular models may also return additional information.
