"""TabPFN with KV cache vs. without on binary classification (synthetic).

`fit_mode="fit_with_cache"` builds a key-value (KV) cache *during* `fit`.
This front-loads the cost of computing the training-set representation so
`predict`/`predict_proba` run faster—especially when:
  • the training set is large, and/or
  • the test:train ratio is small (few predictions per many training points).

Trade-off: additional memory roughly O(N_samples * N_features) to hold the cache.
Implications:
  • Expect *slower* `fit` but *faster* `predict`/`predict_proba`.
  • Benefit grows with train size and repeated inference (CV folds, batch eval, etc.).
